# Parse Modes

> Initially created for and a part of

A **work-in-progress** TypeScript implementation of the
[TDLib](https://github.com/tdlib/td)'s methods related to parse modes and entity matching.

A lot of methods are left to be implemented. I'll list what have been ported when I'm done.
I cannot assure you the quality of the implementation, as I'm not good at C++ (tdlib/td is written in C++).
The tests are direclty ported from TDLib source without a change.
And they seem to be passing. So, I'll take that as a "it works".

But anyway.
