## Parse Modes

<sup>Initially created for [an unofficial testing framework for grammY](https://github.com/dcdunkan/grammy_tests).</sup>

<br/>

A **work-in-progress** TypeScript implementation of the [TDLib](https://github.com/tdlib/td)'s functions and utilities
related to parsing text with several parse modes and matching text entities.

A lot of methods are **left to be** implemented. I'll list what have been ported when I'm done. I cannot assure you the
quality of the implementation, as I'm **not** good at C++ (TDLib is written in C++). The tests are direclty ported from
TDLib source without a change. And they seem to be passing. So, I'll take that as a "it works"!

Anyway, thank you.
