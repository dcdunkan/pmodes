# Parse Modes

> Initially created for and part of [dcdunkan/grammy_tests](https://github.com/dcdunkan/grammy_tests).

TypeScript implementation of the TDLib's parse mode parsing and entity matching algorithms.
The work is still in progress: A lot of methods haven't been implemented and some are only partially implemented.
And yes, the some of the already implemented methods are little buggy as well. But anyway.
